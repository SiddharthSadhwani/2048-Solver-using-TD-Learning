# 2048-Solver-using-TD-Learning
RL Final Project


Created a RL agent for 2048 game based on Temporal-Difference Learning and Multi-Stage Temporal- Difference Learning Algorithms. 

**Result:** The agent was to able to converge to 2048 much faster than humans and with a higher success rate over multiple episodes.
